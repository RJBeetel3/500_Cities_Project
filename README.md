# 500 Cities Project

Health care data was collected in 500 US cities which included health behaviors, interventions and outcomes. An effort was 
made to analyze the data to determine if there were any underlying trends or relationships between behaviors, disease and geography. 
Analysis tools included linear regression modelling and clustering and can be found in the following notebooks:

500_Cities_Data_Exploration4.ipyng
500_Cities_Linear_Regression.ipynb
500_Cities_PCA_Clustering2.ipynb


Raw data is stored in the following csv files. 
* 500_Cities_Health_Behaviors.csv
* 500_Cities_Health_Outcomes.csv
* PATIENT_DEMOGRAPHICS_FIRST24.ipynb
